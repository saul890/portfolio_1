            <p class = "about-para">I picked up photography when I was thirteen, which turned into an appreciation for art in my highschool years. During my final year at school, I was awarded the visual arts prize for my collection of digital artworks about time and space.</p>
            <p class = "about-para"> I've always been creative, but photography and then photoshop is what has pushed me towards following a career in the digital design space.</p>
            <p class = "about-para"> When I began studying, I was confused about what career I wanted to pursue. However, during my degree, I have found a passion for designing with code. I think in a mathematical way, and using code to design feels like you're using maths to describe the properties behind how things look and work. This mesh of mathematical problem solving and creativity is what I want out of a career.</p>
            <p class = "about-para"> I have skills in; Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, Premier, After effects, HTML, CSS, Figma and Miro.</p>
            <p class = "about-para"> I am a quick and humble learner. I am eager to grow my design skills. I am also very hard working, punctual and reliable.</p>
